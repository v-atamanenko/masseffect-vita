This is a backup of your saves.

To restore it, go to ux0:data/masseffect/assets/var/ and do one of two:
1) Remove all files inside (will destroy currently active saves).
2) Move all files inside to somewhere safe.

After that, just grab all files from the folder this README is in, and copy them
to ux0:data/masseffect/assets/var/. That's it!
